:title: Study note for idealized tropical coupled model

# Linear model [WangXie1998]_ potential improvement:

- There is no moisture budget equation. However, this is considered in their later paper [LiuWang2013]_. 
- Cloudiness decreases solar heating, but it does not account for increased downward longwave heating. This impact the sensitivity of :math:`\gamma` in Equation ``A1.h``.
- There is no consideration of precipitation. Therefore, barrier layer effect (salinity) can be added to mixed layer :math:`h_1` evolution.


# Model [LiuWang2013]_:

- They used MJO ``skeleton`` model [MajdaStechmann2009]_, which contains moisture budget equation.
- They did not put longwave radiation feedback into the SST equation.
