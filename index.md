## Research Interest

My research interests are air-sea exchange, MOC dynamics, large-scale geophysical fluid dynamics, and multiple-equilibria of the climate system. The overarching goal is to understand the impact of boundary (air-sea exchange, boundary enhanced diffusivity) on climate stability. I want to work in an environment involving observational data, modeling, and theory.
